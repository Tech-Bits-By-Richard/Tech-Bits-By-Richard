#### Why IT?

My passion for IT is rooted in my curiosity about how things work. I enjoy the process of disassembling a conceptâ€”whether it's a network, a server, or an applicationâ€”and understanding the role of each piece. The most rewarding part is seeing how those individual functions fit together to create a powerful whole.

The world of IT just seems to tickle my brain in the most fascinating way. Itâ€™s always evolving, and thatâ€™s one of the best parts. Because problems change, and so do the solutions, which means there's never a dull moment. That constant challenge is what makes this field so intriguing to me, and it's why I'm always ready to learn what's next.
